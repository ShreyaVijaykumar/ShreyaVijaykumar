# 🌌 Hey, I’m Shreya Vijaykumar!  

💡 **AI/ML | Ideathon Winner | Linux & System Enthusiast**  

I’m all about **blending AI with real-world impact** — from **medical imaging and federated learning** to **AI-driven judiciary apps** and **system-level OS tuning**. Whether it’s **training CNNs for explainability**, working at **Linux kernels**, or exploring **federated architectures**, I love building solutions that are **scalable, ethical, and future-ready**.
