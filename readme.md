# Hey, I'm Shreya Vijaykumar!  

**AI/ML | IEEE Ideathon Winner 2024 | Linux & System Enthusiast**  

I‚Äôm all about **blending AI with real-world impact** from **medical imaging and federated learning** to **AI-driven judiciary apps** and **system-level OS tuning**. Whether it‚Äôs **training CNNs for explainability**, working at **Linux kernels**, or exploring **federated architectures**, I love building solutions that are **scalable, ethical, and future-ready**.

## Tech Blogs
- **[Stop Memorizing Loss Functions in ML - Here‚Äôs How to Actually Understand Them](https://medium.com/@shreyavj.05/stop-memorizing-loss-functions-in-ml-heres-how-to-actually-understand-them-26d6ea59f974)** - This article breaks down the most important loss functions in machine learning. Instead of dumping formulas, I‚Äôll show you where each one belongs, a mnemonic to remember it, and insider commentary you won‚Äôt usually find in textbooks.
- **[How Federated Learning Solves the Accuracy Gap in Heterogeneous Data](https://medium.com/@shreyavj.05/how-federated-learning-solves-the-accuracy-gap-in-heterogeneous-data-8739470447e0)** - I explored Federated Learning (FL) to address a common challenge: improving model performance across clients with heterogeneous data without sharing raw datasets.
