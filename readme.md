# Hey, I'm Shreya Vijaykumar!  

**AI/ML | IEEE Ideathon Winner 2024 | Linux & System Enthusiast**  

I’m all about **blending AI with real-world impact** from **medical imaging and federated learning** to **AI-driven judiciary apps** and **system-level OS tuning**. Whether it’s **training CNNs for explainability**, working at **Linux kernels**, or exploring **federated architectures**, I love building solutions that are **scalable, ethical, and future-ready**.

##  Projects 
-  **[Public Pulse](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/PublicPulse)** – AI-powered judiciary app for transparency & trust in automated decisions.  
-  **[Face Anonymization](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Face_anonymization)** – YOLOv8 model trained for detecting face which can be useful in blurring faces from datas like image which possess threat and privacy concerns of individuals. 
-  **[Federated Learning with Adaptive Optimization](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Enhancing-FL-Adaptive-Optimization)** – Personalized FL achieving **97.92% client accuracy**.
