# Hey, I'm Shreya Vijaykumar!  

I’m all about **blending AI with real-world impact** from **medical imaging and federated learning** to **AI-driven judiciary apps** and **system-level OS tuning**. Whether it’s **training CNNs for explainability**, working at **Linux kernels**, or exploring **federated architectures**, I love building solutions that are **scalable, ethical, and future-ready**.

##  Projects 
-  **[Adaptive Feedforward MLP Driven Anomaly Recognition Framework using the LSNM 2024 Dataset](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Adaptive-Feedforward-MLP-Driven-Anomaly-Recognition-Framework-using-the-LSNM-2024-Dataset)** - This repository contains an optimized Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using PyTorch and evaluated on the LSNM 2024 dataset, a modern large-scale benchmark for network anomaly detection.
-  **[Federated Learning with Adaptive Optimization](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Enhancing-FL-Adaptive-Optimization)** – Personalized FL achieving 97.92% client accuracy.
-  **[PathMNIST-XAI: Explainable CNN for Medical Imaging](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/PathMNIST-XAI-Lightweight-Explainable-CNN-for-Medical-Imaging)** - Lightweight Explainable CNN for PathMNIST medical imaging, achieving 91%+ accuracy with Integrated Gradients, SQLite attribution storage, and scalable PyTorch deployment.
-  **[Performance Analysis of models using Microsoft Safety Incident Prediction](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Performance-Analysis-of-models-using-Microsoft-Safety-Incident-Prediction)** - A complete comparative analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models on the Microsoft Security Incident Prediction (GUIDE) dataset. This project evaluates SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN, and ResNet on 2M training and 0.5M testing samples of high-dimensional security telemetry.
-  **[AgeWell Admin Portal](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/AgeWell-Admin-Portal)** - A lightweight Admin Portal, using Flask + SQLite3 web app for small NGOs and orphanages to securely record and track visitor entries, donations, managing expense, track events and hold health records and personal details of staff, abandoned kids and elders all at one place.
-  **[Recipe Management Website](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Recipe-Management-Website)** - A Flask + MySQL web app to create, manage, and share recipes with image uploads, allergen tracking, and vegetarian/non-vegetarian categorization.
-  **[Public Pulse](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/PublicPulse)** – AI-powered judiciary app for transparency & trust in automated decisions.
-  **[Face Anonymization](https://github.com/ShreyaVijaykumar/Face_anonymization)** – YOLOv8 model trained for detecting face which is useful for blurring faces in images to protect privacy, which possess threat and privacy concerns of individuals.
